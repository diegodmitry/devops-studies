#  SSH Remote Server Setup with Fail2Ban

This project walks you through setting up a **remote Linux server** and securing it using **SSH key authentication** and **Fail2Ban** to protect against brute-force attacks.

[SSH Remote Server Setup](https://roadmap.sh/projects/ssh-remote-server-setup)

##  Project Goals

* Launch a remote Linux server (e.g. on DigitalOcean, AWS, Oracle Cloud, GCP)
* Generate and configure **two SSH key pairs**
* Allow SSH access using either key
* Configure **SSH aliases** for easy login
* Install and configure **Fail2Ban** to protect against unauthorized access

---

##  Requirements

* A cloud provider account
* A Linux terminal with `ssh`, `ssh-keygen`, and `nano`
* Basic knowledge of SSH and file permissions

---

##  Setup Instructions

### 1. Generate SSH Keys (on your local machine)

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_user1
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_user2
```

---

### 2. Upload SSH Public Keys

* During server creation, upload the first key (`id_rsa_user1.pub`)
* After login, manually add the second key:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa_user2.pub
```

Paste the output into the server’s `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

---

### 3. Connect to Server

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_user1 root@<server-ip>
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_user2 root@<server-ip>
```

---

### 4. SSH Config (Optional)

Edit `~/.ssh/config`:

```ini
Host server1
    HostName <server-ip>
    User root
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_user1

Host server2
    HostName <server-ip>
    User root
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_user2
```

Usage:

```bash
ssh server1
ssh server2
```

---

##  Fail2Ban Setup

### Install Fail2Ban

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fail2ban -y
```

### Configure Fail2Ban

```bash
sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

Ensure `[sshd]` section looks like this:

```ini
[sshd]
enabled = true
port    = ssh
logpath = %(sshd_log)s
maxretry = 3
bantime  = 600
```

Restart and enable Fail2Ban:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
```

Check status:

```bash
sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
```

---

##  Testing

* Try logging in with the wrong password 3 times
* Run `sudo fail2ban-client status sshd` to confirm the ban

---

##  Optional Security Hardening

* Disable root login via SSH
* Disable password login (`PasswordAuthentication no`)
* Set up `ufw` firewall to allow only SSH (port 22)
